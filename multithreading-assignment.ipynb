    "1. What is multithreading in python? why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",
    "Ans-Multithreading in Python refers to the capability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently, allowing it to perform multiple tasks in parallel. A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a program, and multithreading enables a program to utilize multiple threads to perform tasks simultaneously. This can lead to improved performance and better resource utilization, especially in situations where the program needs to perform I/O-bound tasks (such as reading/writing files or making network requests).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit the effectiveness of multithreading when it comes to CPU-bound tasks (tasks that require a lot of processing power) because only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time in a single process due to the GIL. However, for I/O-bound tasks, where a lot of time is spent waiting for external resources, multithreading can still provide benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary module used to handle threads in Python is the 'threading module'. This module provides a way to create, manage, and synchronize threads within a program. It provides a high-level interface for working with threads and includes functions and classes to create, start, stop, and manage threads"

    "Q5. State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "Multithreading is a programming concept that involves executing multiple threads (smaller units of a process) within a single process. Each thread shares the same resources of the process, such as memory and file handles, but runs independently. \n",
    "\n",
    "advantages and disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Performance: Multithreading can lead to improved performance on multi-core processors or systems with multiple processors. Different threads can be executed concurrently, making better use of available CPU resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsiveness: Multithreading can enhance the responsiveness of applications. For example, in graphical user interfaces, the user interface thread can remain responsive while background tasks are executed in separate threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process can easily share resources like memory, which can lead to more efficient communication between different components of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism: Multithreading enables concurrent execution of tasks, which is especially useful for applications that perform tasks in parallel, such as simulations or data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multithreading introduces complexity to the code. Managing thread synchronization, avoiding race conditions, and ensuring thread safety can be challenging and error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overhead: Creating and managing threads incurs overhead in terms of memory and CPU usage. Additionally, the switching between threads consumes some processing time, reducing the overall efficiency gained from parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging and Testing: Identifying and fixing issues in multithreaded code can be challenging. Bugs might not always be reproducible consistently, making debugging and testing more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread Safety: Ensuring thread safety and proper synchronization mechanisms requires careful design and implementation. Neglecting thread safety can lead to data corruption and unpredictable behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: While multithreading can improve performance on systems with multiple cores or processors, there might be limitations to how much the application can be scaled due to factors like contention for shared resources.\n"

    "\n",
    "Deadlocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "A deadlock is a situation in concurrent programming where two or more threads (or processes) are unable to proceed because each is waiting for a resource that the other holds. In other words, a deadlock occurs when two or more threads become stuck in a cycle of waiting for resources that will never be released, preventing any of them from making progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "necessary conditions for a deadlock to occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual Exclusion: At least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode, preventing multiple threads from accessing it simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hold and Wait: A thread must hold at least one resource and be waiting to acquire additional resources that are held by other threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from threads; they must be released voluntarily by the holding thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Circular Wait: A circular chain of two or more threads, where each thread is waiting for a resource held by the next thread in the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "A race condition is a situation in concurrent programming where the behavior of a program depends on the timing of events, particularly when multiple threads or processes access shared resources concurrently. In other words, the final outcome of the program is uncertain and may vary depending on the order in which threads execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions occur when multiple threads access shared resources (such as variables, memory locations, or files) simultaneously without proper synchronization. The behavior of the program becomes unpredictable because the order of execution can lead to different results. Race conditions can manifest in various ways, including incorrect calculations, data corruption, or unexpected program crashes.\n"
